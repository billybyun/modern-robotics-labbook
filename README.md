## What this is

This repo is my continuous learning labbook for basic robot control.
It follows structure of **[Modern Robotics (Lynch & Park)](https://modernrobotics.northwestern.edu/)**.  
For each lecture/chapter, the following are included:

- **Own interpretations** of the concepts (WHY-first)
- **Self-quizzes** (in my own words) to test understanding
- **Visualizations** to build geometric intuition  

Shared in case it would be helpful for other people as well.

**Rotation matrices (SO(3))**
- Basis → full rotation
- Yaw / pitch / roll
- Composition: Rx → Ry → Rz
- Space vs body frames
