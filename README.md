# modern-robotics-labbook

Intuition-first Modern Robotics labbook with visualizations and self-quizzes for basic robot control: rotations, transformatoins, SO(3)/SE(3), twists, kinematics, Jacobians, and IK.

## What this is
This repo is my continuous learning labbook for **Modern Robotics (Lynch & Park)**.  
For each lecture/chapter, following is included:
- **Own interpretations** of the concepts
- **Self-quizzes** (in my own words) to test understanding
- **Visualizations** to build geometric intuition  

shared in case it would be helpful for other people as well.

## Chapters
